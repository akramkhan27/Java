        // What is Thread Safety in Java?
        // Thread safety in Java ensures that shared data or resources are accessed correctly 
        // when multiple threads are working concurrently. If a piece of code is thread-safe, 
        // it behaves as expected even when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously without 
        // causing race conditions, data inconsistency, or unexpected behavior.
        
        // How to Achieve Thread Safety?
        // Java provides various mechanisms to make code thread-safe. Here's a structured explanation:  

        // Synchronized
        // Locks     
    }
