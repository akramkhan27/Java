// CountDownLatch is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads 
// to wait until a set of operations being performed by other threads complete.

//  Initialize with a count â€“ The count represents the number 
// of tasks that must complete before proceeding.
//  Threads wait until count reaches zero â€“ A waiting thread 
// will block until all required tasks finish.
//  One-time use â€“ Once the count reaches zero, it cannot be 
// reset (for reusable behavior, use CyclicBarrier).

// 1 The main thread creates a CountDownLatch with a count of 3.
// 2 Three worker threads start, each performing some work (Thread.sleep()).
// 3 Each worker calls latch.countDown() when done, reducing the count.
// 4 The main thread waits using latch.await() until all workers finish (count reaches 0).
// 5 Once all workers finish, the main thread resumes execution.

// new CountDownLatch(int count)-	Creates a latch with an initial count.
// countDown()-	Decreases the count by 1.
// await()-	Blocks the calling thread until count reaches 0.
// await(long time, TimeUnit unit)-	Waits for a limited time before resuming.
// Timeout with await()
// ðŸ”¹ If workers don't finish within the time limit, the main thread proceeds anyway.
