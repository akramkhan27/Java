// interrupt() Method in Java

// The interrupt() method in Java is used to signal a thread to stop or pause 
// its current execution. It doesnâ€™t forcefully stop a thread; instead, it sets 
// the thread's interrupt status to true. The thread can then decide how to handle 
// this interruption, usually by checking its interrupted status and responding appropriately.

// Behavior:

// 1.If the thread is blocked (e.g., waiting or sleeping), the interruption 
// causes the thread to throw an InterruptedException.
// 2.If the thread is running, it does not stop immediately; 
// it just sets the thread's interrupted status to true.
